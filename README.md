This repository contains hands-on machine learning projects covering essential topics like Supervised Learning, Regression, Classification, and Data Analysis using Python. Each notebook demonstrates step-by-step implementation, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

âœ… Included Projects:
Linear Regression (Single & Multiple Variables): Predicting relationships between variables with real-world datasets.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification: Implementing SVM for tasks like diabetes prediction.
House Price Prediction: Using regression models to estimate property values.
Weight vs. Height Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization with seaborn.
Statistical Analysis with NumPy: Basic data science calculations like standard deviation and percentiles.
All notebooks use pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and model training. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced ML enthusiast, these projects will enhance your understanding of machine learning concepts.
